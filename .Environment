Git workflow:
Default branch: dev
For each task create branch using the following naming convention: sprint{{index}}/{{task code}}
Example: sprint7/KCA-78
After the work on the task is finished, its branch should be merged into Release branch of the sprint, which follows this naming convention: sprint{{index}}/Release
Example: sprint7/Release
Bugfixes are made in the Release branch
When sprint is finished and package is delivered to the Kensium team, Release branch should be merged into dev.

Sometimes, CstCustomizationUtil throws an exception, after which all files from KChannelAdvisor.source folder are deleted.

3. Go to
	C:\Acumatica\AcumaticaSites\KChannelAdvisor\Site
